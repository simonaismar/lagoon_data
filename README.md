# lagoon_data IS IT SYNC'd?
This repository gathers matlab scripts to import, process, analyse and plot data from tide gauge, AWAC, Copernicus, ECMWF in a lagoon.

In addition there are some scripts and data to plot some cool Mediterranean maps

Process: it detrends, if necessary normalises, and removes circadian cycle from the series
Analysis: correlation and time lag analysis
Plots: original series, processed series, and time lag stem plot

Note. before running the scripts add to your matlab path the functions in the repository "ancillary"
